### Code and instructions for four examples in `fcat` manuscript

Each of the four examples corresponds to one `.sh` file in this repository. Simply put, there are in total four main steps in analyzing each example after downloading corresponding bam files:
 * `countCoverage` for bam files with specified parameters
 * `extractFeature` for training data
 * `extractFeature` for testing data or data for which predictions should be made
 * `fcat` for training models and making predictions
